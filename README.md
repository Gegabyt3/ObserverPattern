# ObserverPattern
This C# program is used to showcase the observer design pattern. It is about differently priced product objects inside of different spacestation objects (subjects), 
and a spaceship object (observer) that gets the most recent product prices from a station, as long as it is registered as an observer to it. Otherwise the ship counts as being 
in outer space with no products/prices available until it registers as an observer to a station.
